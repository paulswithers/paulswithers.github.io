With Office 2007, Microsoft made a major change in their document formats. Up until that point, Microsoft had preferred closed, proprietary, customer lock-in of content into silos of information. But during the 2000s the rise of Apache OpenOffice and its open document formats, along with governmental demands for interoperability, put pressure on Microsoft to introduce OOXML. Of course it had added benefits - competition alone rarely encourages change. The new format was up to 75% smaller, improved corruption recovery and improved security.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2026/02/01/ai-and-marketing/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2026/02/01/ai-and-marketing/</guid> </item> <item> <title>AI, Tailwind, and The Future of Media</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;AI, Tailwind, and The Future of Media&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently there was an announcement that Tailwind was laying off 75% (3 of 4) of its engineering team because of revenue collapse.

Since being coined by Andrej Karpathy in a tweet in February the term has gained widespread adoption. My job is research, so I&#39;m not one to accept code without review. But I absolutely need to be aware of new technologies and approaches, and evaluate their usefulness. And all technologies improve over time. So AI-assisted coding has been a regular part of my work for 18 months. Over recent weeks I&#39;ve used it more and more, for a wide variety of purposes. And research is not just about trying things, it&#39;s about extrapolating and anticipating future usage.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/12/14/ai-coding-futures/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/12/14/ai-coding-futures/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Effective AI Usage: Managing Hallucination</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Effective AI Usage: Managing Hallucination&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges when working with AI is hallucination.

The obvious omission from all aspects was &lt;strong&gt;AI&lt;/strong&gt;. But AI – like an IDE – is just a tool. Unless you understand what it can and can&#39;t provide, unless you use it intelligently, you will not reap the benefits. But unlike an IDE, AI doesn&#39;t come with a set of menus that hint at what it can and can&#39;t do. AI doesn&#39;t come with a marketplace of extensions that provide functionality shared by the community. And it&#39;s so new that we&#39;re all working it out. So what are my thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/08/16/ai-lessons/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/08/16/ai-lessons/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Supercharging Input to Domino REST API Agents</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Supercharging Input to Domino REST API Agents&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned when building &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/volt-mx-ls-toolkit&#34;&gt;HCL Volt MX LotusScript Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; was that calling a web agent with &lt;code&gt;?OpenAgent&lt;/code&gt; URL populates the &lt;code&gt;NotesSession.DocumentContext&lt;/code&gt; with various fields containing useful information from the request. So when I was building agent processing functionality into the POC that became Domino REST API, I utilised the same approach to provide opportunities to pass contextual information across to an agent.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/08/05/drapi-agents/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/08/05/drapi-agents/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Developing at Speed</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Developing at Speed&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the main outputs of research development is the proof of concept. An early lesson I picked up when I joined HCL Labs was to deliver working code, not slides. And the key when building a proof of concept is speed. In some cases, it may end up proving why an approach &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; work. In many scenarios, it may end up being put on a shelf indefinitely. Even if the concept proves appealing, the implementation choices may not be the preferred option for the final solution. So speed is of the essence: spending a couple of weeks building something that goes nowhere is acceptable; spending a couple of months is not. So the ability to get maximum results in the minimum time is key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how do you do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/06/30/rapid-development/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/06/30/rapid-development/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Adventures in Rust</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Adventures in Rust&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my core principles for IT research development can be summed up by a saying more than 2500 years old, attributed to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon&#34;&gt;Solon&lt;/a&gt; and appearing twice in Plutarch’s Life of Solon: “I grow old always learning many things”.

Even when AI is not at the heart of the project I&#39;m working on, I&#39;m constantly looking for ways it can make my life easier and life easier for developers using what I create. And the fact that we targeted a standard IDE means the effort required to integrate AI is reduced. But as with any new tool, it&#39;s important to learn what it can do and what it can&#39;t. And work this week has shown me that this requires a diligent approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/04/26/using-ai/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://paulswithers.github.io/feed_rss_created.xml">Paul Withers' Blog</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2025/04/26/using-ai/</guid> </item> <item> <title>XPages App to Web App: Part Nineteen: Spots By Date and Stats Pages</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;XPages App to Web App: Part Nineteen: Spots By Date and Stats Pages&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back when the application was on XPages and spots were associated to a trip, there was a summary page that gave stats for the number of new spots, ships, ports, and countries during a trip.
