When IBM introduced XPages, a JSF-based framework, to the stack in 2009 I was one of the early adopters, <a href=\"http://www.intec.co.uk/blog/\">blogging</a>, training, speaking and eventually co-authoring \"XPages Extension Library\" by IBM Press in 2012 and acting as technical editor for \"Mastering XPages 2nd Edition\" by IBM Press in 2014. As a technical evangelist I have been recognised by IBM in their IBM Champion program as an ever-present champion since it's inception for the IBM Collaboration Solutions brand (which includes IBM Domino) in 2011. I've been a committed contributor to open source during that time and I firmly believe in learning through sharing and empowering others. I always try to understand the \"why\" behind the \"what\", and help verbalise that for others too. By sharing code I've learned a great deal from other contributors and through feature requests. Since October 2013 I've been a board member of the open source organisation <a href=\"https://openntf.org/main.nsf\">OpenNTF</a>.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-10-05T15:04:30+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/07/12/background-and-purpose/", "url": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/07/12/background-and-purpose/", "title": "Background and Purpose", "content_html": "<h1>Background and Purpose</h1>\n<p>For the last six years, I have blogged heavily (375 posts in 3 years and nine months, more than one post per week) on <a href=\"http://www.intec.co.uk/blog/\">Intec's blog</a>.

Web applications are deployed as standard web archives, which means it's easy to download and install demos of various frameworks and easy to use Maven. This is something I've fought with when developing OSGi plugins, because Maven is designed to manage and install dependencies be compilation. On the other hand OSGi best practice is to pull them from other plugins, defined in the MANIFEST.MF. At the very least OSGi needs the plugins adding to the classpath in the MANIFEST.MF. Tycho is designed to bridge the gap between what Maven expects and what OSGi expects, but it's not great. So a standard web application, sucking any jar files in via Maven, makes life a lot easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-10-05T15:04:30+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/07/26/vaadin/", "url": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/07/26/vaadin/", "title": "Vaadin", "content_html": "<h1>Vaadin</h1>\n<p>Before I started working with IBM's XPages framework in 2009, I was starting to use AJAX calls in web applications and starting to dig into Dojo charting options for an application.

The challenge in the Notes Client was to provide dashboard-style displays and a good way to display documents for action by the current individual. Private views can be used, but impact database performance. So, typically, the approach is to display views that present a  scrollable table of data. Domino's document-level reader security is then used to ensure only the appropriate data is visible. If data is archived appropriately, performance of the database is good enough for many reasonably-sized applications. (Of course, archiving is often omitted from scope of the first phase for the rapidly-developed application, and becomes a case of \"out of sight, out of mind\".) But with the increasing prevalence of web applications replacing Notes Client applications, the ability to display \"my documents\" and use structured searches to display a targeted subset of documents was much easier.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-10-05T15:04:30+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/09/20/taking-titan-to-the-next-level/", "url": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2016/09/20/taking-titan-to-the-next-level/", "title": "Taking Titan to the Next Level", "content_html": "<h1>Taking Titan to the Next Level</h1>\n<p>Since earlier this year when I started trying to get a better handle on the breadth of graph database options available for a developer, Titan has been an option I have kept in regular contact with.

Whereas traditional REST services have fixed endpoints that take fixed parameters and return fixed data objects, GraphQL is a sort of \"API-as-a-service\". You call an endpoint, pass a JSON object determining what elements of which data you want to return, include any dynamic variable values. The queries are passed to an engine at a REST service endpoint which parses the JSON passed, replaces any variables with the dynamically passed values, and returns just what the application or user asks for. This may include data from what, in a traditional REST API application, would be from different REST endpoints. For example, to get members and messages from a space, you might need to make a REST call to get the space ID, then another REST call to get its members, and a third to get the messages.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-10-05T15:04:30+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/graph-database-news/", "url": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2017/01/13/graph-database-news/", "title": "Graph Database News", "content_html": "<h1>Graph Database News</h1>\n<p>Last year I <a href=\"./2016-09-20-taking-titan-to-the-next-level.md\">blogged</a> about an initiative to take TitanDb to the Apache Foundation as an incubation project.
