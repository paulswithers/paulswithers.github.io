# Graph Database News

Last year I [blogged](./2016-09-20-taking-titan-to-the-next-level.md) about an initiative to take TitanDb to the Apache Foundation as an incubation project. Yesterday, the next step for TitanDb was announced, when the Linux Foundation [welcomed JanusGraph](https://www.linux.com/blog/Linux-Foundation-welcomes-JanusGraph), a project which uses TitanDb as its starting point. The current [documentation](http://docs.janusgraph.org/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/) will look familiar to anyone who has investigated TitanDb, but the news will be welcomed by the TitanDb community. So it's worth keeping an eye on the [JanusGraph website](http://janusgraph.org/).

Also yesterday, I picked up a tweet that pointed to a new [Java Client for IBM Graph](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/java-graph). Considering IBM Graph is using TitanDb and Apache Cassandra, the lack of a Java SDK was a significant downside for me. So it's good to see that IBMers have released this client, as well as a [sample application](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/hello-graph-java).
