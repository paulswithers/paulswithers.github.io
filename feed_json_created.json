With Office 2007, Microsoft made a major change in their document formats. Up until that point, Microsoft had preferred closed, proprietary, customer lock-in of content into silos of information. But during the 2000s the rise of Apache OpenOffice and its open document formats, along with governmental demands for interoperability, put pressure on Microsoft to introduce OOXML. Of course it had added benefits - competition alone rarely encourages change. The new format was up to 75% smaller, improved corruption recovery and improved security.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2026-02-01T22:04:44+00:00", "date_published": "2026-02-01T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2026/01/12/ai-and-media/", "url": "https://paulswithers.github.io/blog/2026/01/12/ai-and-media/", "title": "AI, Tailwind, and The Future of Media", "content_html": "<h1>AI, Tailwind, and The Future of Media</h1>\n<p>Recently there was an announcement that Tailwind was laying off 75% (3 of 4) of its engineering team because of revenue collapse.

Even if the concept proves appealing, the implementation choices may not be the preferred option for the final solution.
